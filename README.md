# TSPC-Latch
Low Power VLSI Project

### Introduction

* The True Single-Phase Clocking (TSPC) latch, a fundamental CMOS circuit element in digital logic design, offers high-speed performance with simple clock generation and distribution. TSPC latches provide efficient temporary data storage by capturing and holding digital values until overwritten. They synchronize different parts of a circuit, ensuring accurate timing and reliable operation. TSPC latches feature a small number of clocked transistors, enhancing their speed and efficiency in digital systems. 

* There are two types of  TSPC latches
1. Precharged TSPC Latches (PN and PP type)
2. Non-precharged TSPC latches (SP and SN type)
